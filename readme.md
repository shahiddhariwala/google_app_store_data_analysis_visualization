# Google App Store Analysis Project

Have you ever wondered how the app stores work and what factors contribute to an app's success? In this project, we will delve into the world of app store analytics, replicating some of the functionalities provided by popular companies like App Annie or Sensor Tower. By analyzing thousands of apps in the Google Play Store, we aim to gain valuable insights that can inform app development and marketing strategies.

## Project Overview

In this module, we will focus on analyzing various aspects of the Google Play Store, such as app categories, download numbers, pricing strategies, and revenue. By exploring these factors, we can better understand the app landscape and identify promising opportunities for app development.

## Key Objectives

Throughout this project, we will tackle the following objectives:

1. Comparing app categories: Assess the competitiveness of different app categories, including Games, Lifestyle, Weather, and more.

2. Identifying popular categories: Determine which app categories offer compelling opportunities based on their popularity and user demand.

3. Analyzing pricing strategies: Evaluate the impact of app pricing by comparing the number of downloads for paid apps versus free apps.

4. Estimating reasonable charges: Determine appropriate price points for paid apps based on market trends and consumer behavior.

5. Revenue analysis: Identify the paid apps that have generated the highest revenue and analyze their success factors.

6. Cost recovery analysis: Determine the number of paid apps that have recouped their development costs based on sales revenue.

## Learning Objectives

Throughout this project, you will gain hands-on experience in the following areas:

- Data cleaning: Learn how to efficiently remove duplicates and unwanted symbols from app data and convert it into a numeric format.

- Data manipulation with Pandas: Explore techniques to handle columns containing nested data, using Pandas for efficient data wrangling.

- Data visualization with plotly: Discover how to create compelling and informative data visualizations using the plotly library.

  - Vertical, horizontal, and grouped bar charts: Present categorical data in visually appealing formats.
  
  - Pie and donut charts: Visualize proportions and categorical distributions in an easy-to-understand manner.
  
  - Scatter plots with color scales: Utilize color scales to create visually stunning scatter plots.

## Getting Started

To begin the project, follow the instructions and code provided in the Jupyter notebook. The notebook will guide you through the necessary steps for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. Make sure to have the required libraries, such as Pandas and plotly, installed in your Python environment.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, you will have gained valuable insights into the inner workings of the Google Play Store. You will have learned how to analyze app categories, evaluate pricing strategies, and visualize data effectively. These skills will not only enhance your understanding of the app ecosystem but also provide valuable guidance for future app development and marketing endeavors.

So let's dive in and uncover the secrets of the Google Play Store together!
